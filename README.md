A simple webapp to keep track of monthly expenses.  

So far it's a very barebones Backbone.js UI.  I will be hooking it up with Node.js and Mongodb as soon as I figure out how. 

This is an app I am building for myself to do one thing:  Track the bills I have paid and not paid using a monthly allotment. 

There are many apps out there that handle this task, but I wanted something to fit exactly what I was looking for.  Nothing more, nothing less.  

Will keep a changelog of features added.  

Changelog:

March 2013 - v0.01:

App will display list of bills pulled from static file data.json and show remaining balance from static file month.json which will be replaced by (data/month/:id) later.

Not much to see yet, but hopefully soon.
